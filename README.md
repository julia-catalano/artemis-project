This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


Thanks for checking my app out! I chose a trivia app because trivial pursuit is my favorite game. Imagine the questions, though all nature based, are all plant based! For ease of testing it out, the first answer is always the correct answer.

To start the game:

npm install
npm start

To test, in another terminal while the app is running, run:
npx cypress run
When cypress opens, click on trivia_tests.js in the cypress runner
